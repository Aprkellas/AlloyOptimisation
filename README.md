Domain:
Class library for all analysis logic for the alloy optimization. This library can be imported into other projects and reused as needed. Interfaces implemented where needed, as to provide the possibility of extension to the domains contained functionality.

Tests:
The test suite offers a selection of tests for the domain logic, testing all functionalities, and also comparing against the supplied results in Table 3 of the brief, where necessary.
